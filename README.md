# PlaylistPolice

Allows you to whitelist spotify users for your collaborative playlists

## Usage
Once the repository is cloned, read and follow the secrets.format.py file.
When you have your secrets.py configured run the main.py file.
You will then be prompted to insert a playlist URI, the program will then filter your playlist's tracks and save a backup pickle file.
