# PlaylistPolice

Allows you to whitelist Spotify users for your collaborative playlists.

## Usage
Once the repository is cloned, read and follow the secrets.format.py file.
When you have your secrets.py configured run the main.py file.
You will then be prompted to insert a playlist URI, the program will then filter your playlist's tracks and save a backup pickle file.

Note: The owner of the playlist needs to use their account to create the app credentials. Spotify doesn't allow you to edit other people's collabs through the API.
